Breakout #1 – Your First Chart
🎯 Goal:
Reinforce fellows' understanding of how to render a basic chart in a Tkinter application using matplotlib. This exercise builds confidence with figure creation, widget layout, and plot customization.

📝 Instructions:
Fellows should:

    Based on the code provided from the original static chart, create a step tracking chart using the following data:
    days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
    steps = [4500, 6700, 7200, 5000, 9800, 11000, 7600]

Customize the data:

    Replace X and Y values with something real: temperatures, heart rate, daily steps, grades, etc.


Enhance the chart:

    Add a chart title

    Add X and Y axis labels

Extra Challenges (time permitting):

1) Track two people’s steps or compare two datasets.
    example data:
        friend_steps = [5000, 6000, 8000, 7000, 9000, 10500, 8300]

2) Use a bar chart instead of a line chart

3) Add grid lines to the chart
